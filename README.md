This is an example WPF project to help me learn the basics of being an industrial full-stack developer.

It contains the basics of:
1. MVVM-Architecture (with CommunityToolkit.MVVM)
2. XAML and C# in Visual Studio 2022
3. API-Calls (with Refit)
4. Error Handling/Result pattern
5. Dependency Injection (Coding pattern)
   5.1. Decorator Pattern (Function extension)
6. SQLite Database
7. EF Core
8. DB Transactions
9. CRUD Repository Pattern
